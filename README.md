Reading list challenge.
This challenge consists of showing a list of books and adding them to a reading list.
I completed the Challenge using React.js, HTML and Tailwind.
The full challenge guide is here: https://github.com/midudev/pruebas-tecnicas/tree/main/pruebas/01-reading-list
In adittion to the original challenge, I added the search function as well as a "popover" that works on hover made with js, and
made the web responsive.
